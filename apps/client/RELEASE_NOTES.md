## 1.9.14-beta
This is the final release of Timetabl v1 (barring possible emergency bugfixes).

v2 is currently in pre-alpha (very early testing stage) and can be accessed at
[sbhs.timetabl.app](https://sbhs.timetabl.app).

FAQ:
- **What will happen to Timetabl v1?**
  - You should continue to use Timetabl v1 for now since it is currently more stable and featureful. v2 is in a very early stage and does not contain all the features of v1.
- **Why is there a v2?**
  - Timetabl v2 is designed from the ground-up to be able to function at schools other than SBHS. Most of the work at this stage has been towards the technical groundwork for doing that.
- **Why is v2 ugly/buggy/missing features I like?**
  - Did you read the first FAQ? v2 is in an *early testing stage* so just wait for now and don't use it if you don't like it. At a later testing stage I can start to incorporate feedback.
- **Who made Timetabl v2**
  - Me (Hamzah Ahmed, class of 2026), the same person who made v1. And Ritaz Alam was never involved in Timetabl (despite what his Discord bio once suggested).
